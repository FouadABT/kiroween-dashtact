## Getting Started

### What is Dashboard Customization?

Dashboard customization allows you to personalize your workspace by:
- Adding widgets that display the information you need
- Arranging widgets in a layout that works for you
- Removing widgets you don't use
- Saving your custom layout for future sessions

### What You'll Need

- An active account with appropriate permissions
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- Basic familiarity with drag-and-drop interfaces

### Your First Customization

Let's customize your dashboard in 3 simple steps:

1. **Navigate to your dashboard** - Go to any dashboard page (e.g., `/dashboard`)
2. **Click "Edit Layout"** - Find the button in the top-right corner
3. **Make changes** - Add, remove, or rearrange widgets
4. **Save** - Click "Save Changes" when you're done

That's it! Your custom layout is now saved and will appear every time you visit this page.

## Understanding Your Dashboard

### Dashboard Pages

Your dashboard consists of multiple pages, each serving a different purpose:

- **Overview** - Main dashboard with key metrics
- **Analytics** - Detailed analytics and reports
- **E-commerce** - Sales, orders, and inventory
- **Users** - User management and statistics
- **Settings** - System configuration

Each page can have its own custom layout!

### Widgets

Widgets are the building blocks of your dashboard. They display information or provide functionality:

**Types of Widgets**:
- **Stats Cards** - Display key metrics (users, revenue, orders)
- **Charts** - Visualize data trends (line, bar, pie charts)
- **Tables** - List data with sorting and filtering
- **Activity Feeds** - Show recent actions and events
- **Quick Actions** - Buttons for common tasks
- **And many more!**

### Layout Grid

Your dashboard uses a 12-column grid system:
- Widgets can span 1-12 columns
- Smaller widgets (3-4 columns) fit side-by-side
- Larger widgets (6-12 columns) take more space
- The layout automatically adjusts for mobile devices

---

## Customizing Your Layout
